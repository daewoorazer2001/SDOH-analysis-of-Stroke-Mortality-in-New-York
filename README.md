# SDOH-analysis-of-Stroke-Mortality-in-New-York

Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States and is a major cause of serious disability for adults. About 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year.
A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die.

Summarily according to dataset obtained from CDC, we can conclude based on linear regression and statistical evidence that ‘Diabetes’ most contribute to risk of Stroke Hospitalizations in New York State, followed by ‘Smoke Status’ and ‘Obesity’ respectively.

Based on the dataset, there is no statistical correlation between ‘Stroke Hospitalization and Afib Values. Hence, we would conclude this is a null hypothesis. However the chart shows the values of Afib Hospitalizations across NewYork counties with Chemung having the highest and New York having the lowest.
